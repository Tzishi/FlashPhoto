		<p>The FlashPhoto application is both a photo editer and a paint application.  This application can not only load and save images, but also has a variety of tools for editing.  It's tools rang from a pen to being able to blur where every your mouse goes.  It also has a variety of filters to distort the image.</p>
		<!-- Note: following line is an excerpt from the project description -->
		<p>The MIA application is powerful but much smaller than FlashPhoto since it is a very special-purpose tool. The thing that makes this application so interesting is that it can run in two different modes. If you start it without specifying any command-line option, MIA should run in a graphical mode that looks like a streamlined version of FlashPhoto. When a command-line argument is specified, MIA should run in a command-line mode where this is no graphical user interface. For example, running “MIA in.png -sharpen 5 out.png” will produce a new image out.png that is a sharpened version of in.png. This mode is useful for scripting and creating workflows that can be applied repeatedly to large medical imaging collections. </p>
